# ERC20 Sample Token

A simple ERC-20 token contract built on the Ethereum network. This repository demonstrates the basics of writing, testing, and deploying a smart contract using Solidity and the Hardhat framework.

## Features
- **ERC-20 Standard Compliance:** Implements `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom` methods as per the ERC-20 standard.
- **Testing with Hardhat:** Includes a test suite using Mocha/Chai to verify the token's behavior.
- **Deployment Scripts:** Simple Hardhat deployment scripts to a local test network (like `Hardhat Network`) and instructions to deploy to testnets (e.g., Goerli).

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 14.x
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
